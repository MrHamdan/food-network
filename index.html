                <p class="recipie-p">Beefsteak, often called just steak, is a flat cut of beef with parallel faces,
                    usually cut
                    perpendicular to the muscle fibers. In common restaurant service a single serving has a raw mass
                    ranging from 120 to 600 grams (4 to 21 oz). Beef steaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled.
                    The more tender cuts from the loin and rib are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole.</p>

                    additionally characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until the flavors are
                    extracted, forming a broth.</p>
